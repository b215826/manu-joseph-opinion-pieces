## Technical details

The file `links.html` was extracted by scrolling through the [author
URL][author] and viewing the source using Firefox's inspect element
tool.  The various functions of the `scraper.py` Python script are then
used to extract the links and convert them into Markdown using
[readability-lxml][] and [pandoc][].  The makefile then generates the
ebook from the Markdown sources.
